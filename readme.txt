Passle is an easy to use blogging platform for knowledge businesses. This plugin displays the latest posts from your Passle on a WordPress site.

== Description ==

What is Passle?

Passle is a simple and effective way to get all the highly knowledgeable but time poor professionals in an organisation to create content for your on-line presence.

By using a Chrome extension or Bookmarklet embedded in your browser (which takes 2 or 3 seconds), you and your colleagues can create engaging posts in 5 or so minutes rather than 3 or 4 hours.

How to use Passle?

1. Capture the Key Point of an article by highlighting a piece of text, image or video.
2. Hit the Passle button (extension or bookmarklet).
3. Comment with your own (expert) viewpoint, then select an image and give your post a title.
4. Add perspective by choosing tweets to go alongside.
5. And that's your post done.

Now you can use the in-built tools to feed your Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+ presences.

What does Passle Feed Widget do?

The Passle Feed Widget allows you to easily add the latest posts (thumbnail, title, link & date) to the sidebar or footer of your WordPress website.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `passle-feed-widget` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. To display the Passle Feed widget on your site, go to Appearance menu > Widgets.
4. Drag `Passle Feed Widget` onto the chosen widget area.
5. Enter the widget title, number of posts to display, and whether you want to show the thumbnail images.
6. Enter your Passle shortcode ID which could be found in Passle > Settings > Publishing Options (see FAQ for more info).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

How do I find the Page ID of my Passle blog?

Log into your Passle Account. Go to the chosen Passle > Settings. You will find your shortcode ID in the `Publishing Options` section. In WordPress, copy and paste the ID into the Passle ID field in your widget.

Can I display feeds from multiple Passle blogs?

Not in the same feed, you would need to create two separate widgets with 2 unique IDs.

How can I edit the styles of my feed widget? 

The font and link styles will automatically inherit from your WordPress website stylesheet. You can tweak them further by applying changes to the stylesheets located in the plugin’s ‘css’ folder.

Can I display the feed from a Passle Private Group?

Not at the moment. The Private Group is private for a reason!
